## Getting Started

### Dependencies

This project uses the ASP.Net framework with packages installed to support the Session, Authentication and Sql Server.
Connection to the private SQL database will be required with a username and password to successfully run this project.


## Branch Structure

The branching of this project was decided to be feature-based therefore each branch is a seperate feature of the project that an individual works on.
This allows less chances of conflicts during merging and clean trail of code. 
Once the code is finalised, the branch is pushed to the online repo and then a pull request is to be generated to merge into the main branch.
The pull request is reviewed by the group and approved for it to be merged into the main branch.
